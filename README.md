right now this isn't much of anything, just a simple app that lets you import text files of socks5 proxies, one per line, along with the proxy list i used.

this relies on mongo to store the proxies, but other than that, i don't think there's really much to worry about

uh...''' yeah okay 

more features to come eventually
